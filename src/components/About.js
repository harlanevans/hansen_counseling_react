                I moved to the desert seeking healing and learning, and boy did
                I find it! I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, with my
                academic career starting in 2007. With a Bachelors of Science in
                Psychology and Family Consumer Human Development from Utah State
                University, I preceded to graduate from Arizona State University
                with my Masters in Counseling in 2013. I have been practicing
                now for seven years and it has been such a wonderful learning
                experience. I have continued my journey and received my 200
                level Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) certificate this last year.
                Along with my RYT certificate, I am trained in EMDR, Mindfulness
                Based Stress Reduction, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy
                (DBT). The populations I love to work with are teenagers (12 and
                up) and young adults/college age men and women. I love to work
                with Empath or Highly Sensitive People, and those people who
                just need a break!
