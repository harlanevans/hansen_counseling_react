        With my academic career starting in 2007, I received a Bachelors of
        Science in Psychology and Family Consumer Human Development from Utah
        State University. I preceded to graduate from Arizona State University
        with my Masters in Counseling in 2013, and have been practicing the art
        of healing since.

        In my fifth year of practice, I received my 200 level Registered Yoga
        Teacher (RYT) certificate in 2018. I am also trained in EMDR,
        Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy
        (DBT).

        I dont think talk therapy is always the best route for everyone.
        Sometimes a person needs to <b className="landing-bold">move.</b> A person needs actual <b className="landing-bold"><i>practice </i></b> using
        skills will help them, so when they are outside of group, they know in
        their bones what to do when they are in distress. I know that our bodies
        have more wisdom and natural ability to heal on their own than we think,
        <i> especially</i> in the realm of emotional and mental healing. <b className="landing-bold">We need to give
        these amazing bodies of ours the space to do so.</b>

            I’ve been obsessed with mindful movement ever since I could
            walk—climbing trees, playing sports, trail running, swimming,
            lifting, and now moving and breathing Yoga.

            I was sorted into Hufflepuff, wish I could major in Herbology, and
            often ask myself “What Would Dumbledore Do”?

            Recently, I’m crazy about the ocean. We haven’t explored all the
            mystery in there, so obviously I believe in mermaids.

          <li>Phoebe from Friends is my spirit animal. </li>

            My favorite yoga pose is either Happy Baby or Tree Pose. I’m tied
            because I love babies and trees with all my heart!

            Brutus and Kiko are my two dogs and absolute favorite souls to be
            around.

            My favorite fleeting scent that can never be captured is the
            Creosote Bush after it rains. If you rub the leaves together, it
            smells like Phoenix after a good rain.
