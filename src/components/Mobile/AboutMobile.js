            <AboutText>
              I moved to the desert seeking healing and learning, and boy did I
              find it! I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, with my academic
              career starting in 2007. With a Bachelors of Science in Psychology
              and Family Consumer Human Development from Utah State University,
              I preceded to graduate from Arizona State University with my
              Masters in Counseling in 2013. I have been practicing now for
              seven years and it has been such a wonderful learning experience.
              I have continued my journey and received my 200 level Registered
              Yoga Teacher (RYT) certificate this last year. Along with my RYT
              certificate, I am trained in EMDR, Mindfulness Based Stress
              Reduction, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). The
              populations I love to work with are teenagers (12 and up) and
              young adults/college age men and women. I love to work with Empath
              or Highly Sensitive People, and those people who just need a
              break!
