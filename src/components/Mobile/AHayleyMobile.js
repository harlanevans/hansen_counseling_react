            In 2007, I received a Bachelors of Science in Psychology and Family
            Consumer Human Development from Utah State University. I proceeded
            to graduate from Arizona State University with a Masters in
            Counseling in 2013, and have been practicing the art of healing
            since.

            In my fifth year of practice, I received my 200 level Registered
            Yoga Teacher (RYT) certificate in 2018. I also have training and
            experience in EMDR, Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction, and
            Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT).

            using skills will help them in their lives, so when they are
            suffering, they deeply know what to do. Science is proving that that
            our bodies have more wisdom and natural ability to heal on their
            own, especially in the realm of emotional and mental healing.
