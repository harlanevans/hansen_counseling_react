          Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is one of my
            favorite trauma processing modalities. Our bodies and brains know best
            how to heal themselves, but also need some preparation work before
            getting started. I am now doing this preparation through group
            experiential work. Phase Two in EMDR is designed to help clients
            handle the emotional distress they encounter in between sessions while
            they are working with their individual therapists. The Phase 2 skills
            can not only help a person while doing the intensive healing process,
            but long after the EMDR is over. In this group, I combine Yoga and
            breathing practice, as well as teaching Phase Two and Mindfulness
            skills to support clients as they become ready to participate in EMDR
            processing. Read more below! About Yoga: Yoga can be seen as a
            practice to strengthen the body, get a good sweat going, or even a
            competition to see who has the bendiest downward dog? Yoga can be
            these things, but it is so much more. Yoga not only benefits the body,
            but has outstanding healing effects on the mind, the body’s nervous
            system, and spiritual wellbeing. I have had many years using movement
            and yoga to supplement my own healing journey, and because of my
            experience I have recently become a Registered Yoga Teacher with Yoga
            Alliance to supplement my clinical training in healing trauma. I
            figured it was time I use this experiential learning modality in a
            group format to help my clients EXPERIENCE peace, and calm, not just
            talk about it. About Mindfulness Skills: I have training in several
            mindfulness modalities, not just Yoga. Mindfulness Based Stress
            Reduction, as well as Dialectical Behavioral Therapy trainings have
            helped my clients experience emotional balance in their life and
            wellbeing. Put the two together: The first half of group will be
            practicing Yoga and Skills techniques, and the in the second half of
            group, you can expect to sit back on your Yoga props and get ready to
            learn and practice some serious mindfulness and emotional regulation
            skills that will help you regulate, both on and off your Yoga mat. See
            you on your mat weekly, for a two hour fantastic, downward dogging,
            mind-calming, connecting group experience. Important Facts: Cost: 50$
            per session, for 6 weeks, and must be able to commit to 6 weeks. You
            can pay weekly or upfront. I also provide a workbook/binder with the
            skill teachings in it, a 10$ one time fee. When: TBD Where: TBD What
            to Bring: You, water, an open mind, and your yoga mat if you have one!
            If you don’t, I have extra:) Try not to eat a heavy meal before hand
            (yoga+food baby don’t mix well), and feel free to bring a snack for
            the second half of session if you would like. Other: You don’t have to
            have any experience in Yoga, or in any sort of mindfulness training. I
            am trained how to help beginners as well as experienced Yogis. Must be
            seeing a therapist and prepping for EMDR processing to be in group.
