          It has been said that <b className="landing-bold">Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing is "a
          gift from the Gods".</b> In my opinion, it really is. You may have not
          ever heard of EMDR, but I'm sure your body could probably benefit from
          it.{" "}

          When trauma happens (that can be basically anything) it <i>literally</i> gets
          trapped in our bodies. Ever wonder why all of a sudden you smell your
          ex-from-10,000-years-ago's perfume/cologne when walking in the mall?
          It's because the memory gets triggered and your body responds to that
          memory. Now, Iâ€™m really hoping it didn't end too badly with your ex,
          but you can only imagine how it can really get <b className="landing-bold">intense</b> if you got in a
          terrible car accident and that memory gets <b className="landing-bold">triggered.</b> The sound of
          someone dropping a dinner glass can trigger you into feeling you are
          about to get side swiped by some huge metal object. Horrifying!

          The body centered theory suggests that after doing EMDR, eventually
          the car accident memory <b className="landing-bold">will not be as emotionally charged.</b> So that
          means that the next time your girlfriend accidentally drops her wine
          glass, you can just go help her clean up <b className="landing-bold">calmly</b> and <b className="landing-bold">collected. No
          anxiety there.</b> Sounds wonderful, right?

          Francine Shapiro is our homegirl who found that moving the eyes side
          to side, or using bilateral stimulation significantly reduced negative
          thoughts and traumatic memories. EMDR was born, and this full blown
          <b className="landing-bold"><i> body centered magic</i></b> is now used to help reduce almost any form of
          psychological distress.
